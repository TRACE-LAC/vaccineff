#'
#' Subset of data from an anonymised, real-world dataset produced as part of
#' the early stage of the immunization program against COVID-19 in Bogota,
#' Colombia between February 2021 and December 2021. Cohort dataset contains
#' registers of homologous schemes for two different brands for adults aged 50
#' years or older. This cohort received two doses of a vaccine aimed at
#' reducing the risk of death. All the registers were anonymized and
#' de-identified to preserve the privacy of data.
#' The dataset includes disaggregated information on the first and second
#' vaccine doses (vaccine_date1, vaccine_date2, vaccine1, and vaccine2) for each
#' participant and relevant demographic details (sex and age).
#' Additionally, the dataset includes the dates of two outcomes: death
#' associated with COVID-19 (death_date) and death from other causes
#' (death_other_causes).
