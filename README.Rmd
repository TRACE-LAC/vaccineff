*{{ packagename }}* is developed at [Pontificia Universidad Javeriana](https://www.javeriana.edu.co/inicio) as part of the
[Epiverse-TRACE initiative](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

*{{ packagename }}* is an R package that offers tools for estimating vaccine effectiveness (VE), using a series of epidemiological designs including cohort studies, test-negative case-control, and screening methods [@bookvaccine]. The current version of the package provides a set of features for preparing, visualizing, and managing cohort data, estimating vaccine effectiveness, and assessing the performance of the models. Test-negative design and screening method will be included in future versions.

## Installation

The current development version of _{{ packagename }}_ can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the `pak` package.

```r
if(!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("{{ gh_repo }}")
```

## Quick start

```{r cleaning, include = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(vaccineff)
```

*{{ packagename }}* provides a minimal cohort dataset that can be used to test out the models.

```{r example, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# Load example `cohortdata` included in the package
data("cohortdata")
head(cohortdata, 5)
```
The function `make_vaccineff_data` allows defining different aspects of the study design, such as vaccination dates, immunization delays, and potential confounding factors. It creates an S3 object of class `vaccineff`, which will be used to estimate VE using a Cox model regression performed by the function `estimate_vaccineff`. This function returns an object of type `vaccineff`. The proportional hazard assumption can be tested both through the Schoenfeld test and visually using the `plot` method by setting `type = "loglog"`.

```{r}
# Create `vaccineff_data`
vaccineff_data <- make_vaccineff_data(
  data_set = cohortdata,
  outcome_date_col = "death_date",
  censoring_date_col = "death_other_causes",
  vacc_date_col = "vaccine_date_2",
  vaccinated_status = "v",
  unvaccinated_status = "u",
  immunization_delay = 15,
  end_cohort = as.Date("2044-12-31"),
  match = TRUE,
  exact = "sex",
  nearest = c(age = 1)
)

# Estimate VE
ve <- estimate_vaccineff(vaccineff_data, at = 180)

# Print summary of VE
summary(ve)

# Generate loglog plot to check proportional hazards
plot(ve, type = "loglog")
```
